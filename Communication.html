                        <h1>Communication</h1>
                        <p>Communication is a vital component of any workplace, and it plays a critical role in
                            ensuring the smooth and efficient functioning of an organization. Effective
                            communication is essential to building and maintaining positive relationships between
                            employees, teams, and management, and it helps to ensure that everyone is working
                            towards the same goals</p>

                        <p>Non-verbal communication accounts for a significant portion of human interaction. When
                            communicating solely through text, we lose a great deal of nuance. This requires you to
                            be mindful of what you say and how you phrase things, as well as sensitive to what
                            others say.</p>

                        <p>If we improve our communication methods and adhere to general guidelines, we will be
                            able to increase our productivity significantly.</p>

                        <p>Please ensure that you have read the communication guidelines so that you understand
                            what is and is not acceptable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-based">
                        <h1>Text Based Communication</h1>
                        <p>Several methods of text-based communication are in place. Using text messages has
                            many benefits. The first benefit is a readily accessible record of past debates and
                            resolutions. This is helpful for those who can't make it to a meeting, as well as for those
                            who want to review the meeting's past actions at a later time</p>

                        <p>For Text based communication, we use Slack. Slack is a popular communication and
                            collaboration platform used by businesses and teams of all sizes. One of the main
                            advantages of using Slack is that it provides a centralized platform for communication,
                            allowing team members to collaborate, share information, and work together more
                            efficiently. With Slack, users can create channels for different projects or topics, and
                            communicate through direct messages or group conversations. Slack also supports the
                            integration of other tools and services, such as file sharing, task management, and video
                            conferencing. This integration allows team members to easily access the tools they need
                            without having to switch between multiple applications. Overall, Slack can help teams
                            streamline their communication and improve their productivity, making it an effective and
                            valuable tool for businesses of all types Alternative is Semsto Chat, which also help to
                            communicate based on project or
                            individual one</p>
                        <h1>Voice and Video Chat</h1>
                        <p>For voice or video chat we can use skype, zoom and google meets. For Internal
                            communication we will use Skype and for communication with clients we will use zoom
                            or google meet as per convenient of client</p>
                        <h1>In-Person Meetings</h1>
                        <p>In-person meetings provide numerous benefits for team members working on a project
                            or task. Firstly, face-to-face communication enhances the clarity and understanding of
                            ideas and reduces the potential for misunderstandings that can occur through virtual
                            communication. Body language, tone, and nonverbal cues can all be observed, leading
                            to a deeper and more meaningful connection between team members. In-person
                            meetings also foster a sense of team spirit and community, allowing team members to
                            build trust, relationships, and camaraderie that can improve collaboration and
                            productivity. Finally, in-person meetings provide the opportunity to brainstorm and ideate
                            together, leading to better and more creative solutions. Overall, in-person meetings allow
                            for a more engaging, interactive, and productive experience for team members, leading
                            to improved outcomes and higher levels of satisfaction.</p>

                        <p>We will use Semsto for scheduling all meetings. After each meeting, the MOM will be
                            sent to all participants.</p>
